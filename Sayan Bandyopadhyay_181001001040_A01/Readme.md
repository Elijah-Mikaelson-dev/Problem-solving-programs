Q1: Implementation of Arithmetic Operations on Polynomials.
 Suppose p1(x)= a0 + a1*x^1 + a2*x^2 + ... + ak1*x^k1  and 
                       p2(x)= b0 + b1*x^1 + b2*x^2 + ... + bk2*x^k2 two polynomials of degree k1 and k2 respectively. Write a C/C++ program that uses linked list representation of each polynomials to find 
a) Addition of two polynomials, i.e., p1(x) + p2(x) 
b) Multiplication of two polynomials, i.e., p1(x) * p2(x) 

Q2: Implementation of arithmetic operations on Big integers represented as  decimal numbers.
Given two positive integers A and B (which may be so large that they cannot be stored in an in-built data type of your programming language), represent them as polynomials with base 10 (as decimal numbers) with coefficients being integers from 0 to 9. Your objective is to compute the value of A+B (addition) and A*B (multiplication). Write a C/C++ program to solve this problem.
Inputs: two decimal numbers A and B
Output: A+B and A*B, you have to write the results as decimal numbers.
Example: A =    9764300000
